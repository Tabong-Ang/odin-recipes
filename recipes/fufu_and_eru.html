    <h2>Fufu and Eru is a Cameroon traditional dish</h2>
    <p>Commonly found in the Southwest Region of Cameroon, it hails from the Manyu Division (Bayangi tribe).</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Eru</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Palm Oil</li>
        <li>Crayfish</li>
        <li>Waterleaf</li>
        <li>Maggi Crevette</li>
        <li>Beef skin/canda, beef stripes, beef, goat meat, dried/smoked fish, stocked fish, snails, and/or others</li>
   </ul>

   <h3>Preparation Steps</h3>

   <ol>
    <li>If you are using dried Eru, start by soaking it in water.</li>
    <li>Wash your meat and put in the pot to boil. I used beef skin and beef stripes AKA canda and towel.</li>
    <li>While the meat boils, chop your spinach or waterleaf and set aside.</li>
    <li>When your meat is half-boiled, season with salt. When it is cooked, add in spinach and start stirring. Spinach is quite soft and will shrink fast as seen below.</li>
    <li>Then you drain Eru and add to pot. The small liquid from the Spinach will make the Eru soft</li>
    <li>Add in your fish and mix. I had some already boiled stock fish so I threw it in</li>
    <li>Then add the oil, seasoning cube and lastly crayfish. Tip : Mixing palm oil and canola/vegetable oil keeps the oil from becoming hard when the Eru is cold.</li>
    <li>Stir well and voila, Eru is ready. Serve with Water Fufu (Akpu), Garri or even Pounded Yam.</li>
   </ol>
